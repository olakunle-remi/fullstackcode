      <p>The World Wide Fund for 
        Nature (WWF) is an international
         organization working on issues

      <h1>WWF's Panda symbol</h1>
      <p>The Panda has become the symbol of
         WWF. The well-known panda logo of 
         WWF originated from a panda named 
         Chi Chi that was transferred from 
         the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo 
         in the same year of the establishment 
         of WWF.</p>
